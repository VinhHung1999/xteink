```

**Separate file format** (when splitting from README.md):
```markdown
# Title

**Tags:** #tag1 #tag2
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Description
One sentence summary.

## Content
3-5 sentences: what happened, what worked/failed, key lesson.
```

## When to Read Each Folder

| Folder | Read when... |
|--------|-------------|
| `bugs-and-lessons/` | Debugging, or before modifying areas with past issues |
| `architecture/` | Major restructuring, adding new modules/sections, onboarding |
| `frontend/` | Working on website UI, components, pages, styling |
| `backend/` | Working on API, database, payment/shipping integrations |

---

## Adding New Memories

1. Determine which folder the memory belongs to
2. Read README.md in that folder first (avoid duplicates)
3. For small additions: append to README.md
4. For detailed entries: create a new `.md` file in the folder and link from README.md
5. Keep entries short: max 3-4 lines each
6. If new info contradicts old entry, update inline with "**Updated:**"
