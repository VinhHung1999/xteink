## 10. KEY INSIGHTS FOR LANDING PAGE REBUILD

### Content Strengths
1. **Clear value prop:** "Redefining how we read" + lifestyle scenarios
2. **Three-step simplicity:** "Snap, Flip, Read" is memorable and visual
3. **Vietnamese-first:** Complete localization as competitive advantage
4. **Social proof:** Press + community testimonials build trust
5. **Low friction:** Multiple payment options, free shipping, 30-day returns

### Structural Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure:** Hero specs → lifestyle use cases → deep features → social proof → purchase info → FAQ
- **Visual storytelling:** Lifestyle photography over spec sheets
- **Benefit-focused:** "Lighter than an egg" vs. "74g"
- **Scannable:** Short sections, clear headings, bullet points

### CTAs
- **Primary:** "Khám phá X4 — Từ 1.490.000đ" (Explore X4)
- **Secondary:** "Mua ngay" (Buy Now) in header
- **Tertiary:** Individual product "Add to cart" buttons

### Missing/Underdeveloped
- **Library not live yet** (70K books promised but coming soon)
- **No bundle deals** (accessories sold separately, potential upsell opportunity)
- **Limited X3 content** (marketed as "ultra-rare" but minimal differentiation)
- **No comparison tool** (X3 vs X4 side-by-side would aid decision-making)

### Design Considerations
- **Glassmorphism + animations** may impact performance — test on slower devices
- **Vietnamese typography** requires Be Vietnam Pro font (already in design guidelines)
- **Mobile-first** critical for Vietnam market (high mobile e-commerce adoption)
- **Accessibility** — ensure E-Ink benefits are clear (no blue light for health)
