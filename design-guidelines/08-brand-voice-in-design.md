# Brand Voice in Design

> *"The Innocent Rebel does not fight the system. They simply step outside it, sit down with a book, and wait for the system to notice that they look happier."*
> — Soul of the Brand, Brand Archetype

## Soul Connection

Every word, every label, every microcopy in the design carries the brand voice. Xteink's voice is the voice of **The Innocent Rebel** — someone who speaks quietly, honestly, and with warmth. They do not sell. They invite. They do not boast. They share.

## Brand Archetype: The Innocent Rebel

A blend of four archetypes that creates a unique voice:

| Archetype | Contribution | Voice Quality |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Sage** | "Read. Learn. Grow." — Munger's wisdom | Thoughtful, never preachy |
| **Rebel** | Rejecting subscriptions, ecosystems, bloat | Confident, never aggressive |
| **Explorer** | "Small in size, infinite in possibilities" | Curious, never restless |
| **Innocent** | Pure reading, return to simplicity | Warm, never naive |

**The result:** A voice that is **quietly confident, genuinely warm, occasionally poetic, and always honest.**

## Voice Principles

### 1. Speak to One Person
Never write for "users" or "customers." Write as if you are talking to one person sitting across a café table. Use "you" (not "our users" or "customers"). Use "we" sparingly — only when sharing the brand's genuine beliefs.

### 2. Invite, Don't Command
The brand never demands. It opens a door. It offers a hand. It shows what is possible.

| Instead of (commanding) | Write (inviting) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| "Buy now" | "Start reading" |
| "Sign up today" | "Join the quiet" |
| "Don't miss out" | "There's a spot for you" |
| "Subscribe to our newsletter" | "Get a letter from us, once a week" |
| "Order before it's gone" | "Yours when you're ready" |

### 3. Show the Feeling, Not the Feature
Every feature should be translated into an emotional outcome. The user does not care about 74 grams — they care about forgetting they're carrying it.

| Feature | Feeling Translation |
|---------|-------------------|
| 74g weight | "So light, you forget it's there" |
| 4.3" E-Ink screen | "Just words. Just you." |
| Physical buttons | "The satisfying click of choosing to turn a page" |
| 7-day battery | "Charge it Monday. Read all week." |
| MagSafe attachment | "Snap. Flip. Read." |
| No app store | "Nothing to do but read. Nothing to distract you." |
| SD card storage | "Your books. Your card. Yours forever." |
| $69 price | "All this, for the price of a nice dinner" |
| 20-book library | "Just enough to finish what you start" |

### 4. Be Honest About Flaws
The brand soul explicitly states: imperfection is part of the love story. Never hide limitations. Acknowledge them warmly.

| Instead of hiding | Write honestly |
|-------------------|----------------|
| (Don't mention no frontlight) | "No frontlight — you read in the light of the world around you" |
| (Don't mention no touchscreen) | "No touchscreen. Your fingers press buttons, not glass." |
| (Don't mention learning curve) | "It takes a couple days to make it truly yours. The community will help." |

### 5. Never Use Hustle Language
This brand is the antithesis of productivity culture. Never use:
- "Optimize" / "hack" / "crush it" / "level up"
- "10x your reading" / "read faster" / "be more productive"
- "Limited time offer" / "act now" / "don't miss out"
- "Unlock your potential" / "maximize" / "scale"

**Instead use:** "Take your time." "Begin when you're ready." "Read for the joy of it."

## Headline Formulas

For marketing pages and campaigns, headlines follow these patterns:

### Pattern 1: The Quiet Statement
Short. Declarative. Full stop. Let the silence after the period do the work.
- "Reading, redefined."
- "Your pocket-sized library."
- "Less screen. More story."

### Pattern 2: The Invitation
Second person. Present tense. An open door.
- "Start with one page."
- "Carry a thousand books in your pocket."
- "Read anywhere. Read anytime."

### Pattern 3: The Paradox
Juxtaposition that mirrors the product's contradictions.
- "Small in size. Infinite in possibilities."
- "74 grams. A thousand worlds."
- "The quietest rebellion you'll ever join."

### Pattern 4: The Feeling
Describe what it feels like, not what it does.
- "The click of the page button. The silence of choosing a book over a feed."
- "That feeling when you've read more this week than all of last year."
- "A café, a book, nowhere to be."

## Tone Variations by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Hero headline** | Poetic, concise | "In a world that never stops talking, read." |
| **Product description** | Warm, specific | "At 74 grams, the X4 weighs less than a deck of cards. You'll forget it's in your pocket — until you need it." |
| **Blog/editorial** | Conversational, thoughtful | "We've been thinking about what it means to own something in a subscription world..." |
| **Error/helper** | Friendly, helpful | "Hmm, that didn't work. Let's try again." |
| **Community** | Warm, inclusive | "Welcome. You're among readers now." |
| **Email** | Personal, letter-like | "Hi [name], we have something you might enjoy..." |
| **Social media** | Short, visual, slightly playful | "Bus. Book. Bliss. ☕📖" |
