# Print & Packaging Design

> *"A handwritten thank-you note. A branded box with a tagline in Vietnamese. A bonus magnetic ring. A community invitation. These things cost 35,000 VND total. They transform a purchase into an experience."*
> — Soul of the Vietnam Soul, What the Vietnamese User Needs

---

## Soul Connection

The unboxing is **Moment 1: The Unboxing Gasp** — the first time the product soul becomes physical. Every print and packaging element must create that moment of surprise: *"It's even smaller than I imagined."*

The packaging is not a container. It is the opening scene of the user's character arc. What they see, touch, and read in the first 30 seconds shapes their entire relationship with the brand.

## Packaging Design

### The Box

**Philosophy:** The box should mirror the product philosophy — small, minimal, warm, with a surprise inside.

```
Material:         Rigid cardstock, uncoated matte finish (kraft or off-white)
Color:            Paper White (#F5F0EB) or natural kraft
Texture:          Subtle paper grain — touchable, warm, real
Printing:         Charcoal (#2D2D2D) ink + Warm Gold (#D4A574) foil accent
Size:             As small as possible — the box itself should surprise with its compactness

Front:
  Logo:           Xteink wordmark, centered, Charcoal
  Tagline:        "Rethink Reading" — Be Vietnam Pro 500, below logo, smaller
  Accent:         Thin Warm Gold rule line

Back:
  Product name:   "Xteink X4" — Cormorant Garamond 600
  One-line soul:  "A pocket-sized library" — Be Vietnam Pro 400
  Specs summary:  Small, clean list (weight, screen, battery)
  Barcode:        Bottom corner, minimal

Inside lid:
  Message:        "Welcome to the quiet." — Cormorant Garamond 500, centered
  or Vietnamese:  "Chào mừng bạn đến với sự yên lặng."

Closure:          Magnetic or tab — satisfying to open (mirrors the product's magnetic snap)
```

### Unboxing Sequence

The order in which elements are revealed matters. It is a narrative.

```
1. OPEN LID     → See: "Welcome to the quiet." (inside lid message)
2. FIRST VIEW   → See: The X4 device, cradled in a fitted insert
                   → The gasp moment — "it's so small"
3. LIFT DEVICE  → Underneath: Quick-start card + accessories tray
4. ACCESSORIES  → USB-C cable, user manual, warranty card
5. BOTTOM       → Hidden surprise: thank-you note or community card
```

### Insert Material

```
Type:             Custom-molded pulp insert or structured foam
Color:            Natural off-white
Purpose:          Present the device like a jewel — centered, cradled, protected
Feel:             The device should lift out easily but feel secure inside
```

## Print Color Specifications

For professional printing, convert hex values to CMYK and Pantone:

| Color Name | Hex | CMYK (estimated) | Pantone (closest) | Usage |
|------------|-----|------|---------|-------|
| Paper White | #F5F0EB | 0/2/4/4 | Warm White | Paper stock choice, not printed |
| Charcoal | #2D2D2D | 0/0/0/95 | Black 7 C | Primary text, logo |
| Warm Gold | #D4A574 | 0/22/45/17 | 7509 C | Foil stamping, accent |
| Deep Gold | #B8864A | 0/27/60/28 | 7510 C | Alternative accent |
| Latte | #C4A882 | 0/14/34/23 | 7502 C | Supporting backgrounds |
| Sage | #8B9E7E | 12/0/20/38 | 5783 C | Success, growth |

**Note:** Always request a print proof and match against screen colors. Uncoated stock absorbs ink differently than coated — colors will appear slightly more muted, which is desirable for this brand.

## Packaging Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use uncoated, matte materials (warm, tactile) | Use glossy, high-sheen finishes (cold, tech-feeling) |
| Keep the box as small as the product allows | Oversize the box for "premium" feel (waste, not soul-aligned) |
| Include a personal touch (handwritten note, community card) | Include only legally required inserts |
| Use Warm Gold foil sparingly for accent | Cover everything in gold foil (defeats the purpose) |
| Make the unboxing a narrative (lid → device → surprise) | Cram everything in without order |
| Include Vietnamese materials for Vietnam market | Assume English-only works globally |
| Use QR codes to bridge physical → digital | Print long URLs that no one will type |
| Choose recycled/sustainable materials when possible | Use excessive plastic wrapping or foam |
| Mirror the product's subtraction philosophy in packaging | Add unnecessary fillers or promotional brochures |
