# Digital Applications

> *"The X4 is the most photographable, conversation-starting, identity-signaling eReader ever made."*

## Soul Connection

Every digital touchpoint is a chapter in the user's character arc. The website is Act 1: Curiosity. Social media is Act 5: Advocacy. Email is the quiet thread that holds the story together. Each application must serve its role in the narrative — never shouting, always inviting.

## Website Design

### Landing Page Structure

Based on the **Scroll-Triggered Storytelling** pattern from UI/UX Pro Max — the most soul-aligned approach for Xteink. The page tells a story, not lists features.

```

├── Headline: Cormorant Garamond 600, 48px — "Reading, redefined."
├── Subheadline: Be Vietnam Pro 400, 18px — "A pocket-sized library..."
├── CTA: Primary button — "Start Reading"
├── Subtle scroll indicator (chevron-down, pulsing gently)
└── Background: Paper White with subtle grain texture

SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM — Why This Exists
├── Headline: "You already know this feeling."
├── Short copy: about phone guilt, the to-read list, the gap between who you are and who you want to be

## Social Media Design

### Instagram / TikTok

**Visual identity on social:**
- Always use the brand color palette (warm neutrals, never bright/neon)
- Lifestyle photos dominate — product in context, never isolated
- Text overlays use Be Vietnam Pro 600 in Charcoal or white (depending on photo brightness)
- Subtle Paper White or Charcoal text backgrounds when needed (80% opacity)

**Post categories:**

| Type | Frequency | Visual Style | Caption Tone |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Lifestyle** | 3x/week | Real reading moments, golden light, café/commute/bed | Short, feeling-first. "Bus. Book. Bliss." |
| **Product** | 1x/week | Clean product shot or feature highlight | Feature → Feeling translation. "74g. A thousand worlds." |
| **Community** | 1x/week | User-generated content, reshare reviews | "From our readers:" + quote |
| **Educational** | 1x/week | How-to, tips, book recommendations | Helpful, warm. "3 ways to make X4 truly yours" |
| **Story/Reel** | Daily | Behind-the-scenes, quick reads, trending audio + reading twist | Authentic, slightly playful |

**Instagram Story templates:**

```
Template 1: "Currently reading" — Book title on E-Ink screen close-up
