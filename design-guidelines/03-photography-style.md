# Photography Style Guide

> *"A young woman sits by a window in a small café. It is late afternoon — the light is golden, warm, slanting through glass. Her iced coffee is half-finished. She is not performing productivity. She is in the book. She is in the quiet."*
> — Soul of the Brand, The Vibe in One Image

## Soul Connection

Photography is the single most powerful brand asset for Xteink. The device is small — 74 grams, 4.3 inches. In isolation, it is unremarkable. **In context — in a hand, in a moment, in a life — it tells the entire story.**

The X4 photographs beautifully not because it is flashy, but because it is **minimal against maximal backgrounds**. It is the quiet center of every image.

## The Five Photography Moods

Every photo must belong to one of these five moods from the brand soul. No photo should exist outside this emotional range.

### 1. Soft Focus — Morning
- **Scene:** Balcony reading, first coffee, soft bed with a book
- **Light:** New morning light, pale gold, blue-gray sky through window
- **Feeling:** Unhurried possibility
- **Color temperature:** 5500-6000K (slightly cool, dawn-like)
- **Depth of field:** Shallow — subject sharp, background soft and dreamy

### 2. Pocket Companion — Commute
- **Scene:** Bus, train, metro, waiting in line, walking pause
- **Light:** Warm artificial (bus interior), diffused daylight through transit windows
- **Feeling:** Found time. Stolen minutes.
- **Color temperature:** 4000-4500K (warm artificial)
- **Depth of field:** Medium — both device and environment visible

### 3. Café Stillness — Afternoon
- **Scene:** Café corner, wooden table, iced coffee, window seat
- **Light:** Golden afternoon, warm slanting through glass, golden hour approaching
- **Feeling:** Contentment. Deep presence.
- **Color temperature:** 4500-5000K (golden warm)
- **Depth of field:** Shallow to medium — X4 and coffee in focus, café soft behind

### 4. Winding Down — Evening
- **Scene:** Bed, couch, reading lamp, dim room
- **Light:** Warm lamp light, amber, single light source creating soft shadows
- **Feeling:** Permission to stop. Peace.
- **Color temperature:** 3000-3500K (warm amber lamp)
- **Depth of field:** Very shallow — intimate, close, personal

### 5. Just One More Page — Late Night
- **Scene:** Dark room, pool of lamp light, close crop on hands and device
- **Light:** Single warm light source, darkness around
- **Feeling:** The pleasant trap of a good story
- **Color temperature:** 2800-3200K (very warm, lamp-like)
- **Depth of field:** Extremely shallow — only the page and fingertips in focus

## Composition Rules

### Always Include
- **Hands:** The human element is essential. The X4 should almost always be held, just put down, or being picked up. This creates intimacy and scale reference.
- **Natural light:** Golden hour, window light, overcast soft light, reading lamp. Never flash. Never studio fluorescent.
- **Warm textures:** Wood tables, linen, knit sweaters, leather, cotton, ceramic
- **Everyday objects:** Coffee cups, plants, headphones, notebooks, pens, glasses
- **Urban backdrops:** Café corners, bus windows, park benches, balcony railings
- **Context of life:** The X4 always exists within a real moment — never in a void

### Never Include
- **Cold tech setups:** RGB lighting, gaming desks, triple monitor setups
- **Aspirational luxury:** Marble counters, designer brands, luxury cars
- **Pure isolation:** The X4 alone on white background feels sterile (product shots excepted)
- **Productivity dashboards or hustle culture**
- **People posing with the device as status symbol** — it is not a flex, it is a quiet choice
- **Aggressive studio lighting** — hard shadows, rim lights, dramatic contrast
- **Clutter or mess** — the scene should be calm, not chaotic

### Composition Principles
1. **Rule of thirds** — place the X4 at intersection points, not dead center
2. **Negative space** — at least 40% of frame should be breathing room
3. **Eye-level or slightly above** — intimate, observational, not dramatic
4. **Natural framing** — use doorways, windows, table edges to frame
5. **One focal point** — the X4 or the person reading, never competing subjects

## Product Photography

When the X4 must be photographed as a product (e-commerce, catalog):

### Hero Product Shot
- **Background:** Paper White (#F5F0EB) or Off-White (#FDFBF7), NOT pure white
- **Lighting:** Soft, diffused, single direction — mimicking window light
- **Shadow:** Soft, warm-toned, natural drop shadow (not digitally added harsh shadow)
- **Angle:** 3/4 view, slight tilt — showing both screen and side profile
- **Screen content:** Always show readable text on the E-Ink screen — never a blank screen

### Scale Reference Shots
The X4's size is its most powerful visual feature. Always provide context:
- **In palm** — fingers wrapped around, showing how small it is
- **Next to phone** — magnetic attachment, showing the pairing
- **In pocket** — sliding in/out of jeans, jacket, shirt pocket
- **Next to everyday object** — coffee cup, credit card, passport (for scale)

### Detail/Macro Shots
- **Button close-up** — showing the physical page-turn buttons, implying tactile interaction
- **Screen texture** — close enough to see the E-Ink paper-like quality
- **Magnetic back** — the MagSafe ring, the satisfying attachment
- **Thickness** — edge-on view showing the 5.9mm profile
- **SD card slot** — the tiny card that holds your library

## Lifestyle Photography

### People Guidelines
- **Age range:** Primarily 18-30 (core demographic), occasionally 30-45
- **Appearance:** Natural, unstaged, casual. No heavy makeup. No fashion-forward styling.
- **Expression:** Absorbed, peaceful, lost in reading. NOT smiling at camera.
- **Wardrobe:** Earth tones, neutrals, casual. Linen, cotton, denim. No logos.
- **Diversity:** Represent Vietnamese audience naturally — urban youth, students, young professionals
- **Posture:** Relaxed, comfortable, natural. Sitting cross-legged, leaning back, lying in bed.

### Setting Guidelines
- **Cafés:** Vietnamese café aesthetic — wood tables, iced coffee (cà phê sữa đá), warm light
- **Transit:** Bus, Grab car passenger seat, airport waiting area
- **Home:** Simple apartment, bed, balcony with plants
- **Outdoors:** Park bench, riverside, campus courtyard
- **Workplace:** During a break — not at the desk "working"

### The "Phone Face-Down" Shot
One of the most powerful brand images: a phone lying face-down on a table (the universal gesture of "I'm choosing not to look"), with the X4 magnetically attached or sitting nearby. This single image tells the entire brand story without a word.

## Post-Processing / Editing Style

### Color Grading
- **Overall:** Warm, slightly desaturated — not VSCO-trendy, not Instagram-filtered
- **Shadows:** Slightly lifted, warm-toned (never crushed black)
- **Highlights:** Soft, not blown — preserve detail in bright areas
- **Saturation:** Pull back 10-15% from natural — muted, calm, not vivid
- **White balance:** Always lean warm (never cool/blue cast)

### Specific Adjustments
```
Exposure:     +0 to +0.3 (slightly bright, airy)
Contrast:     -5 to +10 (low contrast, soft)
Highlights:   -20 to -30 (preserve detail)
Shadows:      +15 to +25 (lifted, warm)
Whites:       -10 (soft)
Blacks:       +10 to +15 (never crushed)
Clarity:      -5 to +5 (subtle, not sharp)
Vibrance:     -10 to -15 (muted, calm)
Saturation:   -5 to -10 (pulled back)
Temperature:  +5 to +15 toward warm
Tint:         +3 to +5 toward magenta (warm cast)
Grain:        5-10% (subtle film grain — ties to E-Ink paper texture)
```

### What the Final Image Should Feel Like
- Like a memory of a good afternoon
- Like the warm light just before sunset
- Like a page from a lifestyle magazine, but less polished and more real
- Like something you would save on Pinterest and actually feel something about

## Photography Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Show hands holding the device with care | Show the device floating in abstract space |
| Use natural light from windows, lamps, sky | Use flash, ring lights, or studio strobes |
| Include warm textures (wood, linen, ceramic) | Photograph on cold surfaces (metal, glass, marble) |
| Show real reading moments (bus, bed, café) | Stage fake "reading" poses (model smiling at camera) |
| Lift shadows, keep blacks warm | Crush blacks for dramatic contrast |
| Add subtle film grain (5-10%) | Apply heavy filters or presets |
| Show the device in context with everyday objects | Photograph the device alone on white |
| Capture the "before" moment (phone face-down) | Only show the "after" (reading) |
| Let the moment feel spontaneous and real | Over-direct or over-style the scene |
| Show Vietnamese settings naturally | Use generic Western café aesthetics only |
